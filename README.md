# Perceptron Classifier for Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Perceptron classifier using the famous Iris dataset available in scikit-learn. The Perceptron is a fundamental algorithm for binary classification that learns a linear decision boundary between classes.

## Overview

The Python script in this repository showcases the following steps:

- Loading the Iris dataset, specifically focusing on petal length and petal width as features.
- Preprocessing the target variable to classify Iris Setosa species against other species by transforming classes into binary values (1s and 0s).
- Creating and training a Perceptron classifier to make predictions on the modified dataset.
- Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy metrics.

## Contents

- **Perceptron Model.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code.
- **Requirements.txt**: Necessary libraries and dependencies.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/perceptron-iris-classifier.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Open and run the `Perceptron Model.ipynb` notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).

## Results

The project demonstrates the implementation of a simple Perceptron classifier on the Iris dataset, achieving an accuracy score reflecting its performance in distinguishing Iris Setosa species from others based on petal characteristics.
